# Date & Location  
Updated 23rd day of June, 2025, 0922 hours, from my home in Chennai, India.  

# Weather  
Currently it's 31°C, cloudy & overcast, with some chance of thundershowers, but it feels like 35°C due to sheer humidity. The wind is blowing from the west at 16 km/h. The beach looks tranquil from my balcony.
