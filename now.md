# What I am doing now?
I am having protein shake and monitoring my trades. So far so good. I am pondering whether to scalp a few more? The markets seem volatile but I love the chaos. I plan to go for a long drive later in the day, and maybe grab a cup of black coffee in the late noon. I usually don't drink coffee after 3PM. Dinner with dad and brother in the evening. That's about it.
