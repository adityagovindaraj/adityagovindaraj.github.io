# What I am doing now?
Done with a fantastic morning HIIT workout, spanning over an hour, from 0601 hours till 0702 hours, lifting a cummulative 3744 kgs on a green 72% recovery from previous day. My day has begun perfectly and I just had filter coffee. Now to set my trading plan in motion for the upcoming budget. It's going to be a wild weekend!
