Phone Booth

I’ve been sitting in this phone booth for half-an-hour, pretending to make a call. I was going to call her, but I didn’t. She was supposed to come to Baskin Robbins, but she didn’t. We were supposed to meet at 8am. It’s already 9am and it looks like the skies are about to open up. 

Last night, we made mad love and it was wonderful. She told me she craved chocolate mint ice-cream. It was 1am. I told her let’s go to Baskin Robbins tomorrow morning and have ice-cream. She said ok and it was an ice-cream date at 8am in the morning. 

We were in bed, bare, sweaty, and exhausted yet felt serene and peaceful with our bodies intertwined under the sheets. Her hands mildly stroking my flaccid cock and my right hand cupped her left breasts. Her left thigh over my right, my right thigh grazed her glistened and wet cunt. 

And then out of the blue, she said something I did not expect and shook me. She told me she hated Ronald Reagan and wanted to kill him. Sensing her pain, I tried to diffuse the situation and asked her why she felt that way. Simply she said. He is a bad guy. He is an asshole. And he ruined everything for America. She has been feeling like this ever since he was elected. It’s ok to feel that way, I told her. What can I do to make you feel better, I asked? Nothing she said. She was sullen and looked defeated. I did not know what to say. I told her that the feeling would pass and tried to kiss her on the forehead. She shoved me aside and told me that she didn’t feel like staying longer and was going home. But we’re meeting tomorrow morning at 8am for ice-cream, right? I asked her. Sure she said. She got dressed and went home. 

I’m sitting in this phone booth and it feels like forever since I last saw her. It began drizzling, and then it poured. I was the only person in the phone booth on Park Avenue. I may never see her again.
