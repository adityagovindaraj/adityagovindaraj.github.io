### *Fiduciary with a Difference*

#### SEBI Reg No: INA200011736

#### BASL No: 1142

#### What is the meaning of *fiduciary*?

**Fiduciary** is derived from the Latin word *fidere*, which means "to trust". In this case, the investment adviser (that's me) has the power and obligation to act for the beneficiary (that's you, or the client) under circumstances which require total *trust*, *good faith* and *honesty*.

In simple English -- your interests come before mine.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

**Why did you decide to become an investment adviser?**

Three reasons.

For years I've made decisions on investments & financial planning for myself & my family, and it worked pretty well. Now, I want to put my experience to good use -- to help YOU.

Second, I strongly believe that being a fiduciary is the best way to help anyone. Just as doctors look your health, financial/investment adviser look after your financial well-being. Having more fiduciaries is good for consumers.

Third, it is difficult to find a fiduciary. And, it's even more difficult to find a genuine advisor whose investment advice is tailored to the your specific needs.

**Are you always a fiduciary, and will you state that in writing?**

Yes. My relationship with you is purely fiduciary. The client’s best interest is the key driver of the fiduciary-client relationship. There’s no such thing as part-time fiduciary. Either one is in the fiduciary business, or not. And I’m in the fiduciary business.

**Does anybody else ever pay you to recommend certain products or services?**

No. That would be violation of SEBI regulations. I do not earn commissions on products, and I do not sell products. In order to buy financial products that will be suitable to you, I’ll be happy to recommend some good financial distributors or use the "direct route".

**What kind of advisory services do you offer?**

I offer bespoke financial and investment advisory.

**How much do you charge for your services?**

I charge depending on how complex the client requirements are.

**Are your fees negotiable?**

No.

**What is the minimum threshold to be a client?**

- Willingness to pay fees.
- Willingness to take accountability & responsibility for decisions.

**Who manages your money?**

I do. Actually, I manage my entire family’s assets. It is reasonable to have assets managed by a third party, just to keep my biases in check. For this reason, I have diversified our various portfolios to different asset managers, each having their own unique philosophy. Additionally, a part of our portfolio is directly managed by me. This twin approach helps me achieve two objectives: the first objective helps me refine my own thought process which can help me service clients; the second objective helps me have the skin in the game. Both are absolutely critical for understanding the nature of financial advice.

**How do I contact you?**

First check if you're an accredited investor and obtain the accreditation certification. After doing this, please do send me an message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityagovindaraj/). Introduce yourself, how you found me, tell me why you want me as your financial advisor, and the issues you hope to solve. We will have an in-depth discussion and see if we can be a good fit and work out something concrete to help you out.
